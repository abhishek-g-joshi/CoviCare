## ‚öñÔ∏è Methodology
-	[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) as the CSS framework to keep the UI simple and quick to build.
-	[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) as the Node.js application framework for its basic functionality. Some companies still use ExpressJS so it was important to implement it.
-	[PassportJs](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) for the authentication and authorization.
-	NoSQL database for the flexibility compared to a SQL database, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) in particular because of its prevalence in the industry.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
-	Login, sign-up, Admin role
-	REST API (create, read, update, delete) for Hospitals, comments, and reviews
-	Create routes have authentication
-	Edit, Update, and Delete routes have authentication and authorization
-	[Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)

## üöÄ Getting Started
Create an .env file and add values to the following variables:
```
GEOCODER_API_KEY=
API_KEY=
DATABASEURL=
PASSPORT_SECRET=
ADMIN_CODE=
```
In a terminal window, initialize a Mongoose Database 
```
$ ./mongod
```
In a second terminal window, display the Mongoose Database 
```
$ mongoose
```
In a third terminal window, install dependencies using npm:

```
$ npm install
```
And then run the application with
```
$ npm start
```
<!-- or
```
$ nodemon app.js
``` -->

## üìê Tests
The integration tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test the creation of data, the functionality of the schema, and the functionality of the validation. The tests are iterated over each of the models: covicare, comments, reviews, users.
To run the tests:
```
$ npm test
```
